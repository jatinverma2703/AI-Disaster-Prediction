![image](https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/23a3bc7a-fc18-4cfa-b570-344a286f169d)

## Overview

The **AI-Based Disaster Prediction and Response System** leverages the power of **Artificial Intelligence (AI)** and **Machine Learning (ML)** to predict natural disasters and enhance response efforts. This project focuses on forecasting **floods**, **earthquakes**, and **hurricanes**, providing tools to identify and assist victims in the aftermath of a disaster.

## Features

### Predictive Models for Natural Disasters:

1. **Flood Prediction Model**:  
   Analyzes historical weather patterns, river levels, and precipitation data to forecast potential flooding events.

2. **Earthquake Prediction Model**:  
   Utilizes seismic activity and geological data to predict earthquake occurrences and their potential impacts.

3. **Hurricane Prediction Model**:  
   Uses atmospheric data, ocean temperatures, and historical storm patterns to predict hurricane formations and trajectories.

### Chatbase API Integration:

- Integrated with **Chatbase API** to offer an interactive chat-based interface.  
- Users can receive real-time responses and information related to flood scenarios and safety measures.

### YOLOv5 Model for Post-Disaster Response:

- Deployed **YOLOv5** (You Only Look Once) object detection model to analyze post-disaster imagery and videos.
- Helps in locating and identifying victims, aiding in efficient rescue operations.

## Technology Stack

- **Machine Learning Models**: Python, pandas, numpy, scikit-learn
- **Chatbase API**: Responsive chat interface for user interaction
- **YOLOv5**: Real-time object detection for victim identification
- **Frontend**: HTML, CSS, JavaScript
- **Backend**: Node.js for integration with AI/ML services

## How It Works

### 1. Prediction Phase

- **Data Collection**: Gathers relevant data from various sources, including weather stations, seismic sensors, and oceanographic data.
- **Model Training**: Uses historical data to train machine learning models capable of predicting floods, earthquakes, and hurricanes.
- **Prediction**: The models generate forecasts based on current data inputs, providing early warnings for potential disasters.

### 2. Post-Disaster Phase

- **YOLOv5** is used to analyze imagery and videos from disaster zones, identifying victims and aiding in search-and-rescue operations.

## Installation

### Prerequisites

1. **Git** (for version control)
